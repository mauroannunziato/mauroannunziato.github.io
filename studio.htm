<P>PLANCTON was founded in the 1994 by a group of three artists (Annunziato, Pierucci and Gemma de Julio) and started the activities with a series of artworks and experiments on expressive languages based on the fusion of different media (video, music, painting, installations). Since '98 it was opened an expressive approach based on chaos and artificial life to explore the potentiality of &quot;artificial societies&quot; to create interactive audio-visual environments and emergent behaviour. The relation between art and science, mind and society, communication and interaction are the central topics of the research.
</P>
<P>
The &quot;Plancton Art Studio&quot; was founded by Pierucci and Annunziato in the 2000 in order to support the activity of the Plancton artists in the realization/production of artworks, 
research and art-products utilizing digital media and computer. The 
preferred media are interactive installations for room or public spaces 
and digital prints. We also have produced experimental videos, 
multimedia and musical CDs, software products, acrylic paintings and 
papers. A educational activity is also carried out in collaboration with art academies, universities, research and cultural institutions for post-university masters and seminars. </P>
<P>We collaborate with other artists, research institutions, design 
companies and take part of the main international events, festivals and 
conferences on digital art and emerging technologies. The art activity 
is completely merged with a scientific and technological background. 
This feature has generated a core of proprietary technologies 
specifically developed for art, design and entertainment like wide and 
network-distributed artificial life environments, 3D sound synthesis 
and interaction between human and artificials based on natural movement 
(multiple videocamera) and new communication paradigms.</P>
