  <strong>TOPICS</strong></p>
<p>The workshop tries to sketch out the state of art of the researches in the 
  artistic field of expressive forms tied to the concepts of the artificial life 
  and the virtual worlds. A common thread binds these explorations: the theoretical 
  frame of the complexity and emergence. In this way, the life, the mind, the 
  social structures, the dynamics of the language and of the communication, are 
  seen like phenomena of self-organization through evolutionary processes. <br>
  This context characterizes such artworks for an high degree of autonomy. The 
  artwork can transform itself in the time (generative art) or can manifest itself 
  like an environment from which not predefined forms emerge (art of emergence). 
  In many cases, the visitors can interact (interactive art) with artificial beings 
  or inhabit virtual worlds. The artist has the function of put in action a process: 
  to create an environment and germs of life that will evolve creating shapes 
  that increase their inner structure and complexity along the time. <br>
  The attempt to evoke the mechanisms of the life and the society through the 
  construction of an artificial life is at the same time a provocation in order 
  to discuss about the directions of the near future and also a stimulus to re-think 
  the deepest roots of the man in the light of the new philosophical-scientific 
  paradigms. The workshop does not expect to exhaust all the expressive modalities 
  inspired to these concepts, but it represents a good sample of different expressive 
  media: from the interactive installations to the virtual reality, from the genetic 
  architecture to the virtual worlds on the web. Aim of the workshop is to contribute 
  to the elaboration of a common land between art and science of the complexity. 
  We believe that a cross-fertilization of ideas and inter exchange of methods 
  between art and science is possible at least in this field.</p>

  <font color="#FF0000">Generative art is the idea realized as genetic code of 
artificial objects.</font></strong></p>
<p>Abstract: The generative project is a concept-software that works producing 
  three-dimensional unique and non-repeatable events as possible and manifold 
  expressions of the generating idea identified by the designer as a subjective 
  proposal of a possible world. This Idea / human creative act renders explicit 
  and realizes an unpredictable, amazing and endless expansion of human creativity. 
  This approach opens a new era in design and industrial production: the challenge 
  of a new &quot;naturalness&quot; of the industrial object as a unique and unrepeatable 
  event, mirror of the uniqueness and unrepeatability of man and nature. Argen&igrave;a 
  is the term that we have coined for this genetic code of artificial ware that, 
  like DNA in nature, identifies not only an object but a species of objects. 
  Industrial design will no longer be the idea and realization of an object, but 
  the idea of a species of objects and its industrial generation. We have been 
  inspired to a return to the Renaissance cultural approach, capable of combining 
  science and art. We have created ideas formulating a code of the harmony that, 
  as it is born of the history of man and his relationship with nature, identifies 
  and represents the subjective vision of the possible, the imprinting as a designer. 
  The design act changes from forming to transforming, because each form is only 
  one of possible parallel results of an idea.</p>

  Art</font></strong></p>
<p>Abstract: Several scientific models have simulated Complex Adaptive Systems. 
  These try to model the emergence of complexity within computer-simulated environments 
  inhabited by artificially evolving organisms. My approach is based on the application 
  of complexity and complex adaptive systems to interactive art. With these interactive 
  systems I aim to create dynamic and open-ended image structures that increase 
  in complexity as users interact with them, ideally satisfying some of the key 
  properties of Complex Systems.</p>

  <font color="#FF0000">Emerging Structures in Artificial Societies </font></strong></p>
<p>Abstract: <br>
  Progress in the scientific understanding and simulation of natural evolutionary 
  mechanisms may be creating the basis for a new stage in evolution: the coming 
  of artificial beings and artificial societies. Culture itself, aesthetics and 
  intelligence are coming to be seen as the emergent, self-organizing qualities 
  of a collectivity, evolved over time through both genetic and linguistic evolution. 
  This talk trace the art-science experience in the development of hybrid digital 
  worlds, in which societies of artificial beings autonomously evolve their genetics, 
  language, aesthetics and interaction with the humans. The authors discuss their 
  interactive audio-visual art installations and the scientific backstage for 
  the artwork development and the open questions in the artworks itself. </p>
<p>Bio: Mauro Annunziato and Piero Pierucci are founders of the Plancton media 
  art group. Plancton is an artist-scientist group focalized on interactive installations 
  based on chaos and artificial life to explore the creative potentiality of the 
  artificial societies. Their artworks have been exposed in international art-science 
  festivals (, Siggraph, Imagina, Alife, Generative Art, Virtuality). Annunziato 
  is director of a research laboratory of ENEA (AI, chaos, neural networks, artificial 
  life) and Piero Pierucci is director a laboratory working on voice synthesis 
  and 3D sound modeling. Both are authors of more than hundred scientific publications. 
  Annunziato has been mentioned by NASA-JPL (http://mmp.planetary.org/scien) in 
  2000 as one of the top 60 artist-scientist selected for the Mars Millennium 
  project. http://www.plancton.com</p>

<p>Abstract: Creative (and specifically artistic) artificial systems pose a series 
  of specific problems, one of them being the difficulty to find an adequate quality 
  criterion. In human societies, this assessment is done by means of the interrelation 
  among members of a given culture. Therefore, one way to tackle the problem would 
  be modelling a human society or culture. The Hybrid Society (HS) presents itself 
  as an alternative to solve these questions. It constitutes a development framework 
  where different computational models for tasks requiring creativity and social 
  behaviour may be validated at the same time. HS is based on the idea of machines 
  and humans co-existing in a virtual<br>
  &quot;egalitarian&quot; society. It is opposed to approaches similar to artificial 
  life and to those societies based on co-evolution which constitute purely artificial 
  society models. The aim of HS is to facilitate the design of &quot;social&quot; 
  artificial beings which are capable of developing and asses new creative products 
  showing a great diversity of complex behaviour. It allows the integration in 
  a single framework of computational models developed by any technique or combination 
  of them, and by any research team, enabling their comparison and collaboration. 
  It also allows the comparison among those computational models and human beings.</p>

  <font color="#FF0000">Ambiguity and symmetry reduction in the emergence of structures 
  and the nucleation of visual thinking</font></strong></p>
<p>Abstract: An analogy is proposed between a) the emergence of structures and 
  properties at the critical state of the dynamic instabilities of natural and 
  artificial systems, and b) the nucleation of the visual thinking in our mind 
  during perception and the process of measurement in quantum mechanics. In this 
  frame the role of ambiguity and symmetry reduction is presented, focussing on 
  the specific example of the charge transfer spectroscopy of a homonuclear diatomic 
  molecule and the dynamic perception of ambiguity of a modular structure of the 
  optical art.</p>
<p>Bio: Giuseppe Caglioti is Professor of solid state physics and lecturer of 
  aesthetics, and President of the &#8220;Commissione Cultura at the Politecnico 
  di Milano&#8221;. His interests are now focussed on the technological applications 
  of the results of his research in the fields of the physics of matter and the 
  correlations between natural and human sciences. </p>
