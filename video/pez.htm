<P><IMG SRC="eye.gif" WIDTH=32 HEIGHT=32>Western culture is experiencing a fast transformation: the technological organization of the consumption and the centralized production of <I>communication goods</I>. The process of information concentration is one of the consequences of this scenario, where the use of political power and wild psychoanalysis is widespread. The advertizing or political message is no more restricted to the usual channels (spot, news) but is yet operative in a more general framework, taking advantage of the more advanced formulae of sub-liminal communication strategies. </P>
<P><IMG SRC="eye.gif" WIDTH=32 HEIGHT=32>To "communicate" is easier when the advertising channel is the advertized product itself. It becomes more and more difficult to seek for independent expression if not integrated in <I>information channels </I>managed by <I>enlightened minds</I>. </P>
<P><IMG SRC="eye.gif" WIDTH=32 HEIGHT=32>TV set and radio, telephone and answering machine, book, newspaper and picture, computer and hi-fi, camera and videocassette. The daily objects through which we live most of our social relationships are changing: more functions in one single device, and physical integration with the <I>user</I>. </P>
<P><IMG SRC="eye.gif" WIDTH=32 HEIGHT=32>The <I>cellular communicator</I> cold become vital for us, as it will provide more and more information in a transparent and immediate way.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="eye.gif" WIDTH=32 HEIGHT=32>Ideas and communication styles as multimedia, interaction, virtual reality are dominated, on the other hand, by commercial and economic categories. Behind the scenes, these tools have an intrinsic expressive power that is changing our languages and way of communicate, and the artistic expression is the way in which we can experiment and foresee.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="eye.gif" WIDTH=32 HEIGHT=32><I>PLANCTON</I> develops an artistic project based on the integration of different styles of expression. Following other experiences (<B><I>Renga Art</B></I>, Japan), themes develop around the interaction among several artists, whose personal visions and projects are broken and re-elaborated collectively. The irony, the game, the exchange, is the state of mind when we follow paths that are often broken down by lateral visions. </P>
<P><IMG SRC="eye.gif" WIDTH=32 HEIGHT=32><I>COMO AVANZA EL PEZ</I> is based on different and strictly interconnected contributions: the <B><I>pez</B></I> (fish), <B><I>avanza</B></I> (moves) on his daily confined reality, and is the key of the puzzle. </P>
<P><IMG SRC="eye.gif" WIDTH=32 HEIGHT=32>The painted representation of a fish, and a videotape recording of the same fish, enter a television-container and mixes with his echoes. Water dynamics interlaces with sound architectures which define and evoke an artificial behavior. The irreducible actor, <B><I>el pez</B></I>, lives on the TV screen's confined reality where the excitement-frustration of the communication-containing media models and sculpts the emotional reflex.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="eye.gif" WIDTH=32 HEIGHT=32>The result is an encounter between different expressive ideas, compared through different answers to the same question. From the physical image of the living fish, true and unique hinge of the matter, different observation paths may result: the analytic and rational one, provided by science and technology; the ludic one, apparently tied to the infancy; the synthetic one, from the realm of the artistic expression. </P>
<P><IMG SRC="eye.gif" WIDTH=32 HEIGHT=32>The borderline among different perceptions of <B><I>el pez</B></I> shows their representative nature, in the hope of re-evaluate the dominating <I>techno-centric</I> vision of the western culture, and give more chance to <B><I>creative</B></I> and <B><I>intuitive</B></I> dimensions. </P>
