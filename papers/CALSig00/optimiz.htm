In order to demonstrate the optimization power of the alife 
environments, we have modified the <I>nagual</I> experiment in order to 
obtain a continuos substained evolution. In this new environment we 
have limited the individual extension to a single cell considering only 
the head of the <I>nagual</I> filaments which became points moving in a 
two-dimensional lattice.</P>

Furthermore, in the genoma of each individual we incorporate a new 
block of information that represents the parameters of the specific 
problem to optimize (configuration or solution). On the base of this 
information a <I>fitness function</I> is computed which represent the 
quality connected with the configuration recorded in the genoma. The 
optimization problem consists in the maximization of this function. In 
the reproduction, we apply the mutations only in this block of 
information.</P>
<P>
Upon the meeting of two individuals, a mechanism of competition is 
activated. The competition is based on the value of fitness of the two 
individuals: an individual which has a higher fitness survives. After a 
while, individuals which have higher fitness are able to survive and 
continue the evolution. In this way the best solution, that corresponds 
to the individual with the highest fitness increases continuously its 
presence in the population reaching the optimal values.</P>

Problem</I></FONT></B></P>
<P>
In order to compare the optimization power of the <I>artificial 
societies</I> we have tested the algorithm on several benchmark 
problems comparing the results with other approaches which are not 
problem-dependent. In this section we report the results obtained on 
the Travelling Salesman Problem.</P>
<P>
The Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP <A HREF="refer.htm"><U><FONT
 COLOR="#0000ff">[20,21]</FONT></U></A>) is one of the most famous and 
well-studied optimization problems. Its formulation is the following, 
&quot;Given <I>n</I> towns find the minimal path such that each town, 
except the first, is visited exactly once&quot;. It is known to be a NP 
hard problem and researchers <A HREF="refer.htm"><U><FONT
 COLOR="#0000ff">[23,25,26,27]</FONT></U></A> use this problem as a 
benchmark for optimization algorithms. In order to test the 
capabilities of the artificial life optimization strategy, we 
customized the algorithm to solve TSP and compared the results with 
those obtained with the most successful algorithms based on the genetic 
approach. The numerical experiments have been carried out on two 
classical problems <A HREF="refer.htm"><U><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">[23,24]</FONT></U></A>: 
Oliver30 (30 towns) and Eil51 (50 towns). </P>
<P>
The path, or the ordered list of towns, is the part of the genoma which 
defines the solution of the problem. The fitness corresponds to the 
inverse of the global path. In the reproduction, a son has a very 
similar genoma in respect to its father but a mutation can occurs in 
the list of the town: in particular, two towns can exchange their 
reciprocal position in the ordered list. </P>
<P>
In order to improve the performances of the artificial society we have 
included a modification in the algorithm that allowed the possibility 
to develop cycles of development of the biodiversity in the sense of 
different genoma and cycles of selection. This effect was achieved by 
including modification in the reproduction. In most of the cases, the 
son can survive after the birth only if his fitness is higher than the 
father's. But in very few cases the son can also survive with a lower 
fitness. </P>
<P>
The effect of this assumption is that the population select the best 
individuals by decreasing the probability of new births and 
consequently decreasing the number of living individuals (phase of <I>selection</I>). 
When an individual survives to the father with a low fitness, he is 
able to generate another specie of individuals: the probability of 
birth increases for this species and the number of individuals and 
their information explodes (phase of <I>development of the biodiversity</I>). 
Using this approach, the population have a continuous oscillation 
periodically renewing its content of information. In this figure an 
example of the population oscillation is reported.</P>

The following table shows a comparison among the best results achieved 
by different strategies in terms of path length for the same cities 
locations. In the first column there are the results obtained by 
applying a simple greedy strategy of deep one, the second shows the 
simple Genetic Algorithm <A HREF="refer.htm"><U><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">[18]</FONT></U></A>, 
the third columns show the outcome of the Dynamic Evolution approach <A
 HREF="refer.htm"><U><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">[28]</FONT></U></A>. The 
fourth column exhibits the results of the Ant Colonies Systems <A

fifth those of the Evolutionary Programming <A HREF="refer.htm"><U><FONT

As one can see, the results reached by the present approach are the 
best ones for both test cases considered. </P>
<P>
Obviously, we cannot generalize this conclusion to every optimization 
problem or for the specific TSP problem (we have considered only not 
problem-dependent algorithms), but it is sufficient to demonstrate that 
the optimization power of this approach is at least similar to the more 
classical genetic approaches. Our interest is not only limited to the 
optimization power but also include to the ability to develop new 
configurations due the much more open structure. In fact, in respect to 
the genetic algorithms, the artificial society has an oscillating 
population, the possibility to use the space localization to develop 
local societies (local evolution) and finally the dimension of the 
self-organization.</P>
