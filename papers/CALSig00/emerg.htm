The ideas of evolution, complexity, intelligence and life reproduction, 
have long been stimulating the collective thinking. Scientific 
approaches then become predominant on the formation of hypothesis and 
practices to answer to these basic questions. Research and developments 
carried out around mathematical and physical models of the intelligence 
(Artificial Intelligence) and more recently of life itself (Artificial 
Life) are developing new tools and ideas for the solution of complex 
problems which require evolving structures.</P>
<P>
In problems ranging from traffic regulation to energy process control 
and optimization or evolving virtual creatures, the approaches that are 
based on model adaptation are not sufficient to solve the problem for 
long time. The not-controlled variables, the process aging, the 
irrational components caused by human intervention, the evolution of 
the process, in most of the cases require the change of the basic model 
or the objectives, or even the whole strategy. </P>
<P>
These difficulties expose the limitations of the systems based on the <I>artificial 
intelligence</I> or expert systems. In the expert systems, the 
intelligence of the human expert is formalized in a <I>knowledge base</I>
 and then transferred to the system. The <I>artificial neural networks</I>
 and <I>fuzzy logic</I> <A HREF="refer.htm"><U><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">[17]</FONT></U></A>
 have been developed on the base of the emulation of the human 
reasoning <A HREF="refer.htm"><U><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">[16]</FONT></U></A>
 and they have achieved large success in nonlinear modeling or control 
problems.</P>
<P>
If the knowledge base of the expert is not-optimal, or the knowledge 
model is not accurate, or if the knowledge base or the neural network 
(in example the training data set) are not continuously updated 
following the process variations (<I>continuous learning</I>), the 
system is not able to drive/interpret the process for long time. 
Unfortunately, today it is quite clear that the idea of being able to <I>transfer</I>
 our intelligence to a machine is very difficult to realize in practice<I>.</I></P>
<P>
To reach the goal of evolving structures, the continuos learning of the 
system from the environment is necessary but not sufficient, and an 
ability of the system to change its internal structure is required. In 
short, we need information structures which are able to <I>evolve</I>
 in parallel to the process we are modeling. </P>
<P>
Since late 70's a new branch of theory has been open in the 
evolutionary systems research: the genetic algorithms, starting from 
Holland <A HREF="refer.htm"><U><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">[18]</FONT></U></A>
 and developed in different directions <A HREF="refer.htm"><U><FONT
 COLOR="#0000ff">[19]</FONT></U></A>. In these approaches the algorithm 
structure is able to maximize an optimization function, or to optimize 
a winning strategy simulating some mechanisms of the genetic dynamicss 
of chromosomes (reproduction, recombination, mutation, selection). 
These algorithms have been successful applied in many technological and 
engineering problems, in order to solve optimization <A
 HREF="refer.htm"><U><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">[23]</FONT></U></A> or 
design problems <A HREF="refer.htm"><U><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">[29]</FONT></U></A>.</P>
<P>
The limitation of these approaches is that the internal structure of 
the information is generally static and defined/controlled by the 
author of the algorithm. In such a way these algorithms have been 
demonstrated to be very efficient to solve certain specific problems, 
but they are not really able to develop the necessary intelligence to 
evolve their internal structure. For instance they cannot produce a 
part of itself (<I>autopoiesis </I><A HREF="refer.htm"><U><FONT
 COLOR="#0000ff">[6]</FONT></U></A>). </P>
<P>
A specific concept was introduced in 1960's and 1970's to take into 
account the evolving structures: the <I>self-organization.</I> This 
concept, introduced by Ashby <A HREF="refer.htm"><U><FONT
 COLOR="#0000ff">[1]</FONT></U></A> and Von Foerster, refers to the 
complex systems composed by a multitude of independent entities 
characterized by autonomous chaotic behavior. The self-organization is 
represented by the onset of a global organized structure (order) in the 
system. This concept has been studied by several authors (i.e. 
Prigogine <A HREF="refer.htm"><U><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">[2,3]</FONT></U></A>
 and Kaufmann <A HREF="refer.htm"><U><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">[4]</FONT></U></A>) 
and applied to explain living and not-living systems. Lately, the 
self-organization concept has been adopted in many contexts of 
biological, physical and human sciences (fluidynamics, turbulence, 
laser theory <A HREF="refer.htm"><U><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">[5]</FONT></U></A>, 
social systems, economics, psychology) and it starts to be used for 
industrial applications (granular materials, optimization problems, 
process control and dynamics) through the modeling based on <I>cellular 
automata </I><A HREF="refer.htm"><U><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">[7,8]</FONT></U></A>.</P>
<P>
The fusion of the concepts of genetics algorithms and the 
self-organization brought about the concept of the <I>artificial life</I>
 <A HREF="refer.htm"><U><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">[9,10]</FONT></U></A>
 started in the 80's. for the first time, it has really open the 
possibility to build evolving structures able to develop a completely 
new organization of the internal information. Artificial life is 
generally applied to study biological and social systems using software 
simulators <A HREF="refer.htm"><U><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">[9,11,12,13]</FONT></U></A>, 
and the basic concept is to leave the system with the necessary degree 
of freedom to develop an <I>emergent behavior,</I> combining the 
genetics with other life aspects (interaction, competition, 
cooperation, food network, etc...).</P>
<P>
At the present, artificial life (or <I>alife</I>) is used mainly to 
study evolution problems, but we think that it has the potential to 
generate information structures which are able to develop a <I>local 
intelligence</I>. With the term <I>local intelligence</I> we refer to 
an intelligence very different from the human one, but much more 
connected to the environmental context (<I>the problem</I>) we need to 
solve.</P>
<P>
We are involved in the development of this kind of structures, which we 
call <I>artificial societies </I><A HREF="refer.htm"><U><FONT
 COLOR="#0000ff">[15]</FONT></U></A>. The goal of these structures is 
the solution of a specific class of complex problems (design and 
engineering <A HREF="refer.htm"><U><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">[37]</FONT></U></A>) 
which require evolving structures. The basic idea is: instead of the <I>transfer 
the intelligence through a top-down process</I> we want to<I> develop 
intelligence trough a bottom-up procedure</I>. </P>
<P>
We have developed several environments in order to enhance the aspects 
of self-organization and evolution of the connectivity (the Nagual 
experiment described in the <A HREF="nagual.htm"><U><FONT
 COLOR="#0000ff">section 2)</FONT></U></A> or to solve classical 
optimization benchmark problems (i.e. TSP described in <A
 HREF="optimiz.htm"><U><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">section 3)</FONT></U></A>
 or finally to apply this approach to the control and optimization of 
industrial process for energy production in <A HREF="control.htm"><U><FONT
 COLOR="#0000ff">section 4)</FONT></U></A>. </P>
