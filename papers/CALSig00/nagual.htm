The goal of the environment-experiment (<I>Nagual</I> <A
 HREF="refer.htm"><U><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">[14]</FONT></U></A>) 
described in this section is to show how a simple <I>alife</I> system 
can generate very complex structures characterized by a high degree of 
connectivity and an <I>evolvability,</I> much higher if compared to the 
classic neural network. The experiment tries to enhance some mechanisms 
of development of the information structures and of the internal 
complexity.</P>

The life context is a two-dimensional space initially empty. At the 
beginning, few individuals are placed in the space and they begin to 
reproduce and develop a population. An individual is a filament which 
at the beginning is composed by a single cell. At each evolution cycle, 
the filament grows according to several models of movement and to a 
rate of growing. All the parameters for the dynamics, reproduction and 
death are recorded in a genetic map which is defined at the birth of an 
individual and remain constant throughout the individual life. </P>

The <I>movement</I> (modality of the filament growing) is the 
composition of a deterministic component and a random component. The 
reciprocal importance of the two components is regulated by a 
parameter. High values for this parameter cause a totally random 
movement; low values cause a totally deterministic movement. Different 
models defined <I>characters</I> have been developed for the 
deterministic component. For example, a movement with an uniform 
probability of changing direction; or a higher probability associated 
to pre-fixed curvature; or finally, a movement with a curvature 
evolving with the time. </P>
<P>
The death of the individual can occur for accidental or natural reasons 
or when the length is reduced to zero. Furthermore, if the trail of an 
individual clashes against another individual, generally he dies. A 
very little probability of survival is allowed depending by the clash 
angle. </P>
<P>
The reproduction is asexual and the sons have a genetic map similar to 
that one of the fathers, but some mutations in the genetic parameters 
can occur depending by the mutation rate. Through this mechanism, the 
population evolves and different phenotypes can be developed in the 
same evolution. </P>

The first observation is that the collective development constitutes a 
new entity with its own autonomous and coherent pattern and with 
characteristics descending from the interaction and features of the 
population of individuals. Changing the parameters of the process, the 
set up generates very different patterns remembering the growth of 
populations (plants, animals, neural networks), landscapes (rivers, 
fractures, mountains, cultivated fields), human artifacts (chips, glass 
fragments, architectures) or biological shapes (anthropomorphous 
shapes, animals). All these shapes are characterized by a completely 
different distribution in the space and by different fractal 
dimensions. </P>

The evolution process generates strong changes in the modality of the 
colonization of the life space. This mechanism is due to the dynamic 
action of dominant individuals which act like <I>pioneers</I> who push 
the life in the void space. During this colonization they create strong 
divisions in the space and the subsequent colonization develops local 
communities of individuals (<I>micro-societies</I>). The action of the 
pioneers creates a mechanism of <I>islanding</I> which appears in the 
images as the coexistence of close different graphical phenotypes with 
a limited contamination. The global result is the development of 
biodiversity in terms of different phenotypes. </P>

Another interesting aspect is the changes in the individual phenotypes 
during the evolution due to an emergent selection. At the beginning, 
the smooth curvatures are favorite due to the higher average life they 
are able to reach. During the evolution the micro-societies 
characterized by straight lines are filtered because of they are not 
able to bypass obstacles (high coherence, low flexibility). Excess of 
chaotic micro-societies (high level of irrationality in the curvature 
changes) are filtered because of individuals clash each other (internal 
fight and chaos). In the final part of the evolution, the available 
space is very little and the most favorite phenotypes are 
micro-societies characterized by short paths, high reproduction rate 
and medium irrationality. These societies are able to penetrate in 
every available space. This mechanism produce interesting evolving 
patterns in colors and in the sound organization during the evolution. </P>

Concluding this section we want to remark that this environment is able 
to develop a high level of structured complexity in the connectivity 
tissue. In this sense it generates a potential of information 
connectivity much more similar to the real neural network than the 
classical artificial networks because it is founded on the space and on 
more <I>biological</I> mechanism of development. For this reason, these 
images evoke the natural shapes. Furthermore the dynamics of the 
development is based on adaptation and self-organization dynamics and 
therefore this approach is very promising in term of evolvability.</P>
