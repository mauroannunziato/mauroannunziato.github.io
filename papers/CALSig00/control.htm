application to the control and optimization of processes for energy 
production</FONT></B></P>
</CENTER><P>
</P>
<P>
The main social requirements about the management of energy plants are 
focussed on the maximization of the energy efficiency and minimization 
of environment impact (particularly as regards the reduction of NO<SUB>x</SUB>
 and CO emissions). In this context the process control assumes an 
importance very relevant in respect to the past, especially for the 
combustion plants where the pollutants emissions are strictly related 
to the modality of the process management. Also the complexity of this 
function is widely increased because of it has to take into account 
many targets, like economic management, low environmental impact, plant 
stability and design constraints, energy efficiency. These aspects 
constitute a strong stimulus to develop more advanced strategies for 
the process control and optimization. </P>
<P>
Today, the methodologies for advanced control and optimization (expert 
systems, ARM or neural predictors, process on-line simulators) are 
surely useful for a wide fraction of the industrial requirements, but 
they have serious limitations in many real field applications. These 
limitations could be summarized in the following items:</P>
<UL>
    <LI>
    need of strong modeling (simulators, ARM predictors) 
    <LI>
    need of long training (ARM-Neural predictors) 
    <LI>
    need of heavy knowledge from operators (expert systems) 
    <LI>
    fixed rules for all plant life (off-line, no dynamics, heuristics on 
    critical measures) 
</UL>
<P>
Rarely these requirements are fulfilled for industrial combustion 
plants like waste incinerators or chambers for gas turbines. One of the 
most serious problems for some innovative methods based on learning 
(like neural or fuzzy control, <A HREF="refer.htm"><U><FONT
 COLOR="#0000ff">[17]</FONT></U></A>) is that they are based on fixed 
optimization rules and do not take into account the evolution of the 
plant during its life (i.e. not controlled variables or constraints). 
The learning phase is generally difficult for data lacking and the 
development activities for process optimization require deep knowledge 
of the specific process. Generally, these methodologies are not 
extensible to other processes.</P>
<P>
New advances in the contexts of chaos theory <A HREF="refer.htm"><U><FONT
 COLOR="#0000ff">[31,32]</FONT></U></A> (particularly in the analysis 
of real chaotic systems and complexity), stimulate the research in this 
direction in order to explore new approaches to the process control. In 
particular, nonlinear dynamics allows the possibility to describe the 
state of the process (and therefore the related performance like 
efficiency, emissions, etc.) on the basis of the characterization of 
its dynamics. The recent developments in the field of nonlinear data 
analysis (dynamics invariants), make it more sensible and robust <A
 HREF="refer.htm"><U><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">[30]</FONT></U></A>). The 
complexity description opens the possibility of the development of a 
continuos learning during the plant life and the continuous 
redefinition of the optimization strategy. In spite all these promising 
scientific developments, at present only few studies have been done in 
order to apply them to the plant optimization and control <A
 HREF="refer.htm"><U><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">[35].</FONT></U></A></P>
<P>
We would emphasize that the term <I>optimization</I> here is utilized 
in the sense of a <I>continuous on-line adaptation of the management of 
an existing plant</I>. The goal is to drive the process towards the 
optimal compromise between the management targets deriving the rules 
directly from the measurements.</P>
<P>
The ideas proposed in this paper are aimed to developing a new approach 
to the optimization and control of complex processes for energy 
production/consumption. This methodology is based on evolutionary 
optimization and it started from some successful experiences in the 
dynamic characterization (for diagnostics and control) for at least two 
industrial applications (oil field diagnostics and combustion dynamic 
characterization) <A HREF="refer.htm"><U><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">[33, 34, 
36].</FONT></U></A> Furthermore an optimization study has shown very 
interesting features of artificial life environment with respect to 
more classical genetics techniques. </P>
<P>
&nbsp;The basic features of the proposed approach are:</P>
<UL>
    <LI>
    <I>dynamics based </I>
    <LI>
    <I>no intensive modeling</I> (progressive training directly from 
    the measurements) 
    <LI>
    able to follow the <I>plant evolution</I> 
</UL>
<P>
The essence of this approach could be synthesized by the following 
sentence<FONT COLOR="#800000">:<B> &quot;not <I>control rules</I> but 
autonomous <I>structures able to generate optimized-control rules</I></B></FONT><I>&quot;.</I></P>
<P>
The main processes we are looking for application of the evolutionary 
control in the context of combustion plants are:</P>
<UL>
    <LI>
    Gas Turbines (High pressure, co-generation) 
    <LI>
    Conventional combustion chamber (liquid, low pressure) 
    <LI>

</UL>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE="4" COLOR="#ff0000">The basic idea for the evolutionary 
control</FONT></B></P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="2">The basi</FONT>c idea consists in the reversal of the 
concept of the expert systems (ES). In the construction of the ES, the 
knowledge of the operators is verbally transferred to the ES builder. 
In our proposal, the process knowledge is not verbally transferred, but 
it is developed directly by the system through the measurements 
observation. The driving process is the dynamic building of a model on 
the basis of the observation of the effects that the regulation actions 
(acted by the operators or any other existing control systems) have on 
the plant performance.</P>
<P>
The real implementation of this idea consists in the realization of a 
system which receives measurements from the plant and activates an 
elaborate process based on the two following main steps (see the scheme 
of fig. 1 for a resume of the main components).</P>

<P>
The plant is monitored with <I>process measurements</I> (values of 
process variables averaged on the time interval which defines the 
period of the plant monitoring) and <I>dynamic measurements</I>
 (sensors with dynamic response following the process dynamic 
fluctuation). The dynamic measurements are elaborated on the time 
interval and the chaos invariants are computed. These discriminants 
describe the <I>plant state</I>. The plant state is identified by the 
dynamic behavior which is determined by the dynamical system and the 
parameters values at which the plant is operating. </P>

In 1996 Annunziato and Abarbanel <A HREF="refer.htm"><U><FONT
 COLOR="#0000ff">[33]</FONT></U></A> outlined a new methodology for the 
classification problems based on the attractor morphology using few 
discriminant parameters. This methodology has been successfully applied 
to the identification of the multiphase flow regime in oil production 
plants <A HREF="refer.htm"><U><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">[33]</FONT></U></A>, 
to the characterization of combustion chambers for gas turbines, to the 
characterization of combustibles pollutants in conventional chambers <A
 HREF="refer.htm"><U><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">[36]</FONT></U></A>, and 
finally to the identification of working state of waste incinerators <A

<P>
The basic idea is to describe the attractor morphology that changes 
strongly depending on the operative conditions of the process. The non 
linear dynamics allows a higher sensibility in respect to the linear 
statistics (i.e. FFT). Through the computation a series of 
&quot;moments of inertia&quot; for the attractor, extending in order 
and dimensions, we build a series of shape descriptors, named <I>dynamic 
moments</I>. These moments are computed via which<I> </I>specify 
certain points or axes or planes with respect to which the distances to 
every point of the attractor are computed. For a detailed description 
of the dynamic discriminants see the above mentioned references.</P>
<P>
For the mentioned applications the results obtained in the 
classification were better than that ones corresponding to the FFT 
analysis or to the more classical chaotic invariants (fractal 
dimension, lyapunov coefficients <A HREF="refer.htm"><U><FONT

An artificial environment is created in parallel to the plant capturing 
information from the measurements. In this artificial environment we 
place the <I>live</I> individuals which represent the 
experimented/observed plant conditions. Furthermore, some other 
individuals are generated through a genetic reproduction mechanism. 
Each <I>individual</I> is defined by its genotype which includes the 
plant state description (derived by the measurements), the process 
performance (computed on the basis of the measurements), and the 
regulations state. An evolutionary mechanism selects continuously the 
plant conditions (individuals) which corresponds to the best 
performances. An aging mechanism is provided in order to take into 
account the plant real evolution. </P>
<P>
In respect to the environment presented for the TSP optimization we use 
short filaments instead point in order to increase the probability ot 
meetings between the individuals. During an evolution cycle, the 
filament can growth on the <I>head</I> and decrease on the <I>tail</I>. 
We developed several models for the probability of reducing the 
filament length. Some models are related to a most probable length or 
to a fitness of the individual or finally to the filament age. The 
reduction of the filament length frees space and the life is 
continuously sustained. </P>

An evolutionary mechanism selects continuously the plant conditions 
(individuals) which correspond to the best performances. This mechanism 
is based on the emulation of the natural selection. The interaction 
model is constituted by the competition on the basis of the individual 
fitness (plant performances). In this way the individual with the 
highest fitness can survive and reproduce. The reproduction is asexual 
and the sons have small mutations on the regulation state.</P>
<P>
Because the individual has an &quot;expected life-time&quot;, very old 
individuals can die according to a probabilistic model. This aging 
mechanism is very important to warrant the possibility to lose memory 
of very old solutions and follow the plant evolution. This mechanism 
takes into effect the aging of the optimization models due to the 
changes of not monitored variables (i.e. combustibles in the waste 
incinerators or modifications introduced during the life of the plant). </P>
<P>
The selection mechanisms warrant the selection of the individuals 
(plant configuration) which have produced the highest fitness (best 
plant performances). In this sense the Alife environment is a good 
evaluator of the regulation actions of the operators mixing all the 
operators actions, judging the single control action in terms of 
positive or negative effects on plant performances and building the 
&quot;optimal operator&quot;.</P>
<P>
The distinguishing feature of the proposed system is that the mechanism 
of the mutations introduces new regulation configurations never visited 
before. Therefore the environment has the possibility to generate and 
evaluate plant configurations completely new with respect to ones 
explored by the operators. Fig.2 summarize the optimization and control 
modules. </P>

process control</FONT></B></P>
<P>
For each time period, the process variables are processed in order to 
compute the performance of the plant (the fitness function) in the 
current measurement time frame using a fuzzy logic approach. The 
evaluation of the quality of a plant configuration is made through 
membership functions applied to the process measurements (pollutants, 
efficiency, design constraints). The fusion of these functions is 
obtained through fuzzy operators and it represents the process 
performance (individual <I>fitness</I>). </P>
<P>
In order to evaluate the plant performance in configurations 
(individuals) never visited before we have developed a 
&quot;performance map&quot; model. This model is able to evaluate the 
differences in the process performances induced by a control action (a 
change in the regulation state) starting from a specific dynamic state. </P>
<P>
The dynamic invariants, the regulations actions, and the performance 
evaluation continuously update a <I>performance map</I> built using a 
neural network (based on a Radial Basis Function approach). This map 
gives the possibility to estimate the performance differences induced 
by regulation actions. Compatibly with the statistical accuracy reached 
by the performance map, the best individual is taken at each time 
period as the system suggestion for the regulation actions. The 
suggestion is sent to filters (rule based) which take into account the 
compatibility of the suggested regulation actions with the design 
constraints or stability constraints.</P>
<P>
At the beginning, the system is not able to give suggestion but it only 
learns from the plant measurements. The artificial environment starts 
to become active and gives its suggestions when the performance map is 
quite filled. After each cycle of measurements/suggestions the 
performance map is updated (continuos learning), and new individuals 
are inserted in the artificial environment. In this way the system 
follows the plant not-monitored changes and drives the evolution 
towards better performance.</P>
