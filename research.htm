<HR>
<P>
Here we report the basic ideas involved or inspirating the works of 
Plancton Art Studio. More details of this mix of visionary and 
scientific point of views are reported in the <A
 HREF="papers/papers.htm" TARGET="view">papers</A>.</P>
<P>
</P>
<H3> Artificial Societies and Hybrid Ecosystems</H3>
<P> Through the development of new languages, artificial life is going to be a 
  new creative area of interference between art and science. Research and developments 
  carried out around mathematical and physical models of the intelligence and 
  of life itself, and the appearance of engineering practices for manipulating 
  the biological dynamics, left us with a tremendous need of a cultural and theoretical 
  basement.</P>
<P>
The appearence of the first infohabitants on the network, the first 
intelligent toys, the prototypes of self-reproducing robots let we 
think that the era of the birth of the first world-wide artificial 
society on the web is not so far. Our culture is not still prepared in 
terms of concepts, language and interaction paradigms to this kind of 
events. Our effort would stimulate the discussion and imagination about 
fashion, danger and expressive richness of a new dimension of virtual 
life. In our experiments we recognize an impressive creation power in 
such environments and often we are in doubt if the digital life is 
simulation or real life. To move in this sense we are trying to leave 
the human-machine paradigm of interaction in favour of the local 
interaction in a hybrid ecosystem composed by real and artificial 
people.</P>
<P>
</P>
<H3> The Art of Emergence</H3>
<P> One of the most interesting aspects we consider in our works is the relation 
  between the artist and the artwork in a generative context. In most of the cases 
  this relation is impredicible and many interesting aspects appear as emergent 
  qualities. For this reason we would like enhance this concept in the definition 
  of art of emergence we adopt for our approach. The idea is not the building 
  of shapes or music but design and drive a generative environment able to produce 
  shapes and music. In this way the relation between the creator and the artwork 
  is going to be very dynamic and the artwork seems to have his own personality.</P>
<P>
Another element which can constitute a real challenge in the expressive 
play is to open this relation to the people interaction. The 
interaction with single/few people or with the web community can open 
the evolution to an high dimensionality. The interaction can transform 
the artist-artwork system in an emergent relation between the artist, 
the actors and the artificial individuals. The creative process is a 
dialectical negotiation between the artist, the people and the artwork 
in order to drive, improve, select or simply open the final result.</P>
<P>
</P>
<H3> The Metaphor Engine</H3>
<P> An inspiring idea we like to follow in our artworks is to consider the artwork 
  as a metaphor engine. In the paradigm of the complexity, complex systems constituted 
  by multitude of individuals develop global behavioral properties on the base 
  of local chaotic interactions (self-organization). In the installations the 
  observer can perceive these phenomena as an hidden order without necessarily 
  have a clear consciousness of it. The artificial societies are demonstrating 
  a very high autonomous tendency to the emergence of metaphors for artificial 
  worlds as virtual reflections of the real world. Particularly, we look for dynamics 
  of the communication webs and the mechanisms of formation of collective messages.</P>
<P>
We imagine the cultural systems and the communication webs as systems 
where nothing is pre-determined, but the system evolves through local 
mechanisms of interaction and fundamental events. With a jump in lower 
scale, intelligence, consciousness and psyche can be revised as 
self-organizing phenomena. Starting from the idea that the individual 
context is the emerging own configuration of psychic fragments, the 
interaction between two or more individuals is revised as the 
interaction of two or more micro-societies.</P>
<P></P>
<H3> <FONT COLOR="#000000">Evolvability and Language</FONT></H3>
<P> This topic is probably the most difficult one in term of implementation and 
  reasoning. In the artificial societies the evolvability is the ability of the 
  individuals to generate an incresing complexity, adaptation and evolution of 
  their genetics, phenotypes and structure. In some words they are able to produce 
  parts of itself (autopoiesis).</P>
<P>
After the first experiments we have been able to build environments 
where the individual develop a spontaneous cooperative behaviour 
through the genetic evolution. Following this path, our effort in this 
moment is the building of societies where the individuals are able to 
develop a language negotiated with the real people interacting 
expressed in an aestethic way (sound rithms, colours, etc..). </P>
<P> The difficulties in such development is related to enhance the evolvability 
  degree in the individuals. For these difficulties and for the enormous potential 
  in term of application of these environments we are open to collaborate with 
  art and research institutions and look for public or private financial support 
  for these developments. </P>
