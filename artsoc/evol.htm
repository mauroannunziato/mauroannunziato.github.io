<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><IMG SRC="eye.gif" WIDTH=32 HEIGHT=32>The generation of the images is constituted by the evolution of a population of individuals represented as black points moving (or filaments growing) on the white space of the image (the <I>life space</I>). Each individual is described by a series of genetic characteristics which influence the movement modality (based on a model of <I>random-probabilistic walk</I>) and the probability of reproduction and death. Furthermore, some environmental constraints influence the dynamics of the whole community.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><IMG SRC="eye.gif" WIDTH=32 HEIGHT=32>The parameters of the evolution of each individual are codified through some individual features: character, energy, irrationality, fecundity and mortality. All these features are recorded in a genetic map. The collective development constitutes a new entity with its own autonomous and coherent pattern and with characteristics descending from the interaction and features of the population of individuals. During the evolution, the life space decreases and after a development time, the evolution is concluded. </P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><IMG SRC="eye.gif" WIDTH=32 HEIGHT=32>The <I>character</I> codify the typical movement of the individual. The character <I>unforeseeable</I> is related to a movement with a completely random curvature. For the character <I>tending,</I> a higher probability is associated to pre-fixed curvature. The <I>constant</I> character is related to a movement with low fluctuations around a fixed curvature. The <I>evolutive</I> character is related to a movement with a curvature evolving along the time.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><IMG SRC="eye.gif" WIDTH=32 HEIGHT=32>For each one of the defined characters a random component is associated. The importance of this component is defined by the <I>irrationality</I> feature. Increasing the irrationality, increases the random component. Finally the real movement of the individual is the result of the composition between the individual choice and an environment parameter which is named <I>freedom</I>. At high freedom the individual is free to follow his character. At low freedom the environment tends to impose to the individual the straight movement.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><IMG SRC="eye.gif" WIDTH=32 HEIGHT=32>An individual dies when it meets the trail of another individual. Otherwise it can dies for natural death (depending by a mortality factor). One single individual can generate a son with similar genetic map but with a lower energy. This position is established to evoke the plant growth: the <I>branch-sons</I> are thinner of the parent. The reproduction rate is regulated by a reproduction probability (fecundity). A minimal threshold on the energy is required for the reproduction.</P>
