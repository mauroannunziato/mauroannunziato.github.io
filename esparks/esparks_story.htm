<P ALIGN="left"><font size="-1" face="Comic Sans MS">E-sparks is a long story of ideas, experiments and backstage exploration. We started with the first idea and draft at the beginning of 2000. From 2000 to 2006 several times the target were changed and the prototypes. But we didn't change the Artist Statement and the original structure of the project. </font></P>
<P ALIGN="left"><font size="-1" face="Comic Sans MS">Difficulties arised everywhere: framework, aesthetics,  technologies, scientific references, interaction paradigms, funding. It has been hard to combine all these elements, but it has been a really formative experience walking in the dark..</font></P>

<P ALIGN="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS"><strong>What does it means &quot;communication&quot; ? </strong></font></P>
<P ALIGN="left"><font size="-1" face="Comic Sans MS">This was the starting point of the E-Sparks idea: connect humans and artificials. The problem was to define which kind of communication (bio-chemical, symbolic, semantic). Which kind of symbols ? What does  a symbol is ? from which step of evolution we have to start ? </font></P>
<P ALIGN="left"><font size="-1" face="Comic Sans MS">We started obscillating between the <em>refrence </em>of the<em> ant</em> and the <em>dog</em>. At the end we decided it make no sense take an animal as a reference. We preferred call them just <em>creatures</em>, something of alien from human/animal nature but reflecting something of the human nature. </font></P>

<FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS"></FONT>
<P ALIGN="left"><font size="-1" face="Comic Sans MS">The first backstage experiment was involved in the development of a artificial life environment with a society of evolving creatures. The creatures were equipped with a neural network controlling the movement. During the evolution they were able to develop ability to search and eat food bits to survive. See the paper <a href="../papers/evoart.pdf">&quot;The Emergence of Social Learning in Artificial Societies&quot;</a> for a detailed description. The first shape of creatures was a simple cube. </font></P>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS"><strong>Aurora di Venere</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Comic Sans MS">"Aurora di Venere" was a performance represented in an important italian theatre (Palais de San Vincent). A group of dancers interacted with digital entities projected over two screens located at the background and at the front (semi-transparent) of the theatre's stand. It was also an important source of funds for the continuation of the E-Sparks project. Go to the<a href="../aurora/aurora.htm"> &quot;aurora di venere&quot;</a> to have more info. </font></p>

<P ALIGN="left"><font size="-1" face="Comic Sans MS">In the second backstage experiment the society was able to develop autonomously a common primitive language in terms of the more clear set of symbols used to express a specific content. This experiment refers to the idea of the evolutionary theory of the development of language. To have more details about this experiment you can dowload the paper <a href="../papers/evolang.pdf">&quot;Human-Artificial Ecosystems: Searching for a Language&quot;</a>. The combination of individual learning and social information sharing was really surprising. </font><font face="Comic Sans MS"><br>

<P ALIGN="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS"> <font size="-1">After the robotic voice experiment, we were trying other roads.

This experiment was very interesting: the visitors try to teach the creatures to sing a note sequence or a musical phrase. It was an intersting experiment, but the musical sequence were difficult to recognize and difficult to use for communication. They lack in the semantics.</font></P>

<p align="left"><strong><font face="Comic Sans MS">Interacting with the human shadow </font></strong></p>
<p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Comic Sans MS">A new paradigm for interaction was implemented. It was based on the shadow of the visitors over the screen. the creatures follow the human shadow !! </font></p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<P ALIGN="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS"><strong>Voice, voice, they can speak !!! </strong></font></P>
<P ALIGN="left"><font size="-1" face="Comic Sans MS">Finally Piero developed a voice throat model and an alghoritm for word/sentences classification based on <em>elastic matching</em>. This aspect opened a lot of possibilities in terms of manipulating the human voice. They can speak using the real visitor voice or the synthetic one. </font></P>
<P ALIGN="left">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="left"><font face="Comic Sans MS"><strong>Dialog &amp; fiction </strong></font></P>
<P ALIGN="left"><font size="-1" face="Comic Sans MS">The last step was the development of a learning mechanism in order to search for word/sentences free association (generally is a semantic link). The idea is simple: if you give me an answer to my word I <em>suppose</em> a semantic link could exists between the two words. If this is reinforced by many visitor I became <em>sure</em> that a link exist. In this way after some weeks of interaction with the people each creature build own <em>language network</em>. Then they try to use the language networks to create a fiction of dialog with the people. I have to say they are very intriguing and provocative sometime... </font></P>

<P ALIGN="left"><font face="comic sans MS"><strong>E-Sparks life started this day !!!</strong></font></P>
<P ALIGN="left"><font size="-1" face="comic sans MS">E-Sparks official birth is 14 September 05. In this day the e-sparks society  started to life in the fantastic framework of the ancient roman imperial forum (Mercati of Traiano). This exhibition is two months long with about 3500-4000 visitors/week starting from the first visitor,  the Major of Rome Walter Veltroni. Since that day the creatures are interacting, living and learning each day something more of the italian language and of the romans dialectics. Sometime some creature go out from the co</font><font size="-1" face="comic sans MS">mputer in the night looking the moon over the roman ruins, but this is another story... </font></P>
<P ALIGN="left"><font color="#FF0000" face="Comic Sans MS"><strong>2006</strong></font></P>
<P ALIGN="left"><font face="comic sans MS"><strong>Oopps !!!</strong></font></P>
<P ALIGN="left"><font size="-1" face="comic sans MS"> After the 50.000 visitors at the exibhition of Mercati of Traiano, the E-sparks life changed dramatically. The people have inserted intense human characters in the creatures (vocalisms, words, multilanguages sentences, emotions) and a new question strongly emerge: are the creatures external to us or they are they FRAGMENTS OF OUR MINDS that interact togheter ? The sequence of sentences seems a story of the building of a COLLECTIVE DREAM.</font></P>

<P ALIGN="left"><font face="comic sans MS"><strong>The MART and the collective dream</strong></font></P>
<P ALIGN="left"><font size="-1" face="comic sans MS">In august 2006 we have been invited to exhibit Esparks at MART (Musem of Contemporary Art of Trento and Rovereto). We would like to stress the idea of the collective story-telling and the collective dream. For this reason, in this version the creatures are less visible and they are immerged in evocative images to stimyulate the building of stories from the visitors. Standing and dialoging in the installation, sometimes you think about artificial creatures, other time you can imagine to speak to alien fragments of your mind. </font></P>
